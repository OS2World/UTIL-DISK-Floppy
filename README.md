# UTIL-DISK-Floppy
FLOPPY 0.9 -- an update to FLOPPY.ZIP with a couple of useful fixes. A batch file utility to autodetect when a floppy is changed. Very simplistic, with source.

FLOPPY is designed to be used in batch files to allow the user to proceed immediately after the diskette has been changed.  It may take one or two parameters: a required drive letter and an optional volume name.  FLOPPY will pause until the diskette is changed.  If the volume name was specified then FLOPPY will continue pausing until the new volume is equal to the one requested.
